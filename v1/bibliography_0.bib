abstract = {Novel forces in image segmentation based on active contours models are proposed for capturing objects in the image. Contemplating the common functionality of forces in previous active contours models, we propose the geometric attraction-driven flow (GADF), the binary edge function, and the binary balloon forces to detect objects in difficult cases such as varying illumination and complex shapes. The orientation of GADF is orthogonally aligned with the boundary of object and has the opposite direction across the boundary. It prevents the leakage through weak edges of objects, which occur due to illumination. To reduce the interference from other forces, we design the binary edge function using the property of the orientation in the GADF. We also design the binary balloon force based on the four-color theorem. Combining with initial dual level set functions, the proposed model captures holes in objects and multiple junctions from different colors. The result does not depend on positions of initial contours.}

Snakes are active contour models: they lock onto nearby edges, localizing them accurately. Scale-space continuation can be used to enlarge the capture region surrounding a feature. Snakes provide a unified account of a number of visual problems, including detection of edges, lines, and subjective contours; motion tracking; and stereo matching. We have used snakes successfully for interactive interpretation, in which user-imposed constraint forces guide the snake near features of interest.},

  abstract={A novel scheme for the detection of object boundaries is presented. The technique is based on active contours evolving in time according to intrinsic geometric measures of the image. The evolving contours naturally split and merge, allowing the simultaneous detection of several objects and both interior and exterior boundaries. The proposed approach is based on the relation between active contours and the computation of geodesics or minimal distance curves. The minimal distance curve lays in a Riemannian space whose metric is defined by the image content. This geodesic approach for object segmentation allows to connect classical ``snakes'' based on energy minimization and geometric active contours based on the theory of curve evolution. Previous models of geometric active contours are improved, allowing stable boundary detection when their gradients suffer from large variations, including gaps. Formal results concerning existence, uniqueness, stability, and correctness of the evolution are presented as well. The scheme was implemented using an efficient algorithm for curve evolution. Experimental results of applying the scheme to real images including objects with holes and medical data imagery demonstrate its power. The results may be extended to 3D object segmentation as well.},

The external forces that push the curve to the edges are modified to give more stable results. The original snake, when it is not close enough to contours, is not attracted by them and straightens to a line. Our model makes the curve behave like a balloon which is inflated by an additional force. The initial curve need no longer be close to the solution to converge. The curve passes over weak edges and is stopped only if the edge is strong. We give examples of extracting a ventricle in medical images. We have also made a first step toward 3D object reconstruction, by tracking the extracted contour on a series of successive cross sections.}

  abstract="3D teeth reconstruction from X-ray is important for dental diagnosis and many clinical operations. However, no existing work has explored the reconstruction of teeth for a whole cavity from a single panoramic radiograph. Different from single object reconstruction from photos, this task has the unique challenge of constructing multiple objects at high resolutions. To conquer this task, we develop a novel ConvNet X2Teeth that decomposes the task into teeth localization and single-shape estimation. We also introduce a patch-based training strategy, such that X2Teeth can be end-to-end trained for optimal performance. Extensive experiments show that our method can successfully estimate the 3D structure of the cavity and reflect the details for each tooth. Moreover, X2Teeth achieves a reconstruction IoU of 0.681, which significantly outperforms the encoder-decoder method by {\$}{\$}1.71{\{}{\backslash}times {\}}{\$}{\$}1.71{\texttimes}and the retrieval-based method by {\$}{\$}1.52{\{}{\backslash}times {\}}{\$}{\$}1.52{\texttimes}. Our method can also be promising for other multi-anatomy 3D reconstruction tasks.",

  abstract = { The objective of the present study was the development and clinical testing of a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction method of teeth and a bone tissue of the jaw on the basis of CT images of the maxillofacial region. 3D reconstruction was performed using the specially designed original software based on watershed transformation. Computed tomograms in digital imaging and communications in medicine format obtained on multispiral CT and CBCT scanners were used for creation of 3D models of teeth and the jaws. The processing algorithm is realized in the stepwise threshold image segmentation with the placement of markers in the mode of a multiplanar projection in areas relating to the teeth and a bone tissue. The developed software initially creates coarse 3D models of the entire dentition and the jaw. Then, certain procedures specify the model of the jaw and cut the dentition into separate teeth. The proper selection of the segmentation threshold is very important for CBCT images having a low contrast and high noise level. The developed semi-automatic algorithm of multispiral and cone beam computed tomogram processing allows 3D models of teeth to be created separating them from a bone tissue of the jaws. The software is easy to install in a dentist's workplace, has an intuitive interface and takes little time in processing. The obtained 3D models can be used for solving a wide range of scientific and clinical tasks. }

abstract={A very accurate detection is required for fitting 3D dental model onto color images for tracking the milimetric displacement of each tooth along orthodontics treatment. Detecting the teeth boundaries with high accuracy on these images is a challenging task because of the various quality and high resolution of images. By training Mask R-CNN on a very large dataset of 170k images of patients' mouth taken with different mobile devices, we have a reliable teeth instance segmentation, but each tooth boundaries are not accurate enough for dental care monitoring. To address this problem, we propose an efficient method for object contour refinement using instance segmentation (CRIS). Instance segmentation provides high-level information on the location and the shape of the object to guide and refine locally the contour detection process. We evaluate CRIS method on a large dataset of 600 dental images. Our method improves significantly the efficiency of several state-of-the-art contour detectors: Canny (+32.0{\%} in ODS F-score), gPb (+17.8{\%}), Sketch Tokens (+17.3{\%}), Structured Edge (+12.2{\%}), DeepContour (+15.5{\%}), HED (+2.9{\%}), CEDN (+2.2{\%}), RCF (+2.2{\%}) and also the best result (ODS F-score of 0.819). Our CRIS method can be used with any contour detection algorithms to refine object contours. In that way, this approach is promising for other applications requiring very accurate contour detection.},
